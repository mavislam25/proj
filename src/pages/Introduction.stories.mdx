# Welcome to the Sherpa Storybook
Browse the stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `src/components` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## Using the component library in your project
Install the peer dependencies (omit any you already have installed):

```
yarn add react react-dom @material-ui/core @material-ui/lab @material-ui/pickers
```

Install the component library (TBC pending a deployment location for the built component library npm package).

You then need to add the Material UI theme provider and CSS Baseline near the top of your component tree, for example:

```jsx
import { CssBaseline, MuiThemeProvider, StylesProvider } from '@material-ui/core';
import { theme } from 'sherpa-dls';

/**
 * This function is used to namespace the CSS classNames generated by MaterialUI in the production build. It prevents
 * them from clashing with any pre-built libraries based on MaterialUI, for example this DLS or the navigation menu.
 */
const generateClassNames = createGenerateClassName({
  productionPrefix: 'cbp', // Replace 'cbp' with the name of your app
});

const App = () => <StylesProvider generateClassName={generateClassNames}>
    <MuiThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <CssBaseline/>
        <Root />
    </MuiThemeProvider>
</StylesProvider>
```

If you have already been using MaterialUI and are migrating to using the theme file provided in the DLS, you can have multiple theme providers to allow for a more gradual migration.

### Additional requirements for apps using date pickers
For apps with a date picker you will need to install a date library. There are a number of options in the [material pickers official guide](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/getting-started/installation), however our official supported library is date-fns. Install these official dependencies using:

```
yarn add @date-io/date-fns@1.x date-fns
```

Note that you _must_ use version 1 of the date-fns adapter otherwise it will not work.

You then need to add the utils provider near the top of your component tree, for example:
```jsx
import { MuiPickersUtilsProvider } from '@material-ui/pickers';
import DateFnsUtils from '@date-io/date-fns';
import enLocale from 'date-fns/locale/en-GB';

const App = () => <MuiPickersUtilsProvider utils={DateFnsUtils} locale={enLocale}>
    <Root />
</MuiPickersUtilsProvider>
```

### Technical Guidelines

#### Component Library
We use the [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) component library as the basis for the LUP. Where possible, we use the
vanilla components and style them using [themes](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/). You can find the
themes for the LUP in the `./src/theme` directory.

Note that MaterialUI contains many variations of components which are not currently defined in Sherpa. If you use them without
first consulting the Lidl design team, it's likely that your application will not be compliant. Please contribute any updates to the theme file back into this component library by making a pull request.

#### Styling Components
MaterialUI comes with [makeStyles](https://material-ui.com/styles/basics/) which allows you to programatically generate
styles for your components. Please refrain from using other libraries, such as styled-components which duplicate this
functionality and significantly increases the number of components in the component tree.

For more information about how to customise the look and feel of components, please see the official documentation on [customising components](https://material-ui.com/customization/components/). Note that our order of preference is more general styles within the theme file, where possible.

#### When you need to create new components from scratch
Please follow the Material UI [API Design Approach](https://material-ui.com/guides/api/) so that our in-house components have a consistent API with those found in MaterialUI. Avoid making breaking changes to any existing components as that may cause an adopter project to break downstream.

#### Locales
When a library requires a locale string, always use the **en-GB** locale unless your specific use case calls for an alternative.

#### Dates
It is strongly suggested that you use an immutable date library (i.e not Moment). [date-fns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns)
and [Luxon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/luxon) are popular libraries which are compatible with MaterialUI.

#### Numbers
We strongly recommend that any numbers used for financial calculations are returned to the frontend as strings rather than numbers and processed using [decimal.js](https://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/), which provides a well maintained arbitrary precision decimal type. This mitigates the risk of rounding errors. For an example of rounding errors, try the following calculation in javascript:

```
> .2 + .1
0.30000000000000004

// expected 0.3

```

Using Decimal JS:

```
> new Decimal('.2').add('.1').toString()
0.3
```
